# Data Warehousing Project

## Project Overview
This project offers a hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and querying a data warehouse using PostgreSQL and creating visualizations using Cognos Analytics. It simulates a real-world scenario where participants assist a waste management company in Brazil in managing and analyzing their solid waste collection data.

## Objectives
The project aims to achieve the following objectives:
- Design a Data Warehouse
- Load data into Data Warehouse
- Write aggregation queries
- Create Materialized Query Tables (MQTs)
- Create a Dashboard using Cognos Analytics

## Dataset
The dataset provided for this project is programmatically created for the purpose of the assignment.

## Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL Database access
- Cognos Analytics access

## Project Structure
The project is divided into several exercises covering different aspects of data warehousing and visualization.
